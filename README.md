# Emerging Technologies
![image header](images/JupyterNotebookPython.png)

## Description
This project was created for the purpose of demonstrating emerging technologies in the field of A.I. and Machine Learning. It covers the basic steps needed to understanding Machine Learning.

## Project Timeline
Research

## Content
The repository contains 5 folders. These folders contain various Jupyter Notebooks. See headings below for the contents of each folder:

### NumpyRandom Folder
This folder contains one file which discusses the uses of the numpy random package, along with plots.<br>
**File(s) to note: numpy-random.ipynb**

### IrisDataset Folder
This folder contains one file which discusses the iris dataset, along with its uses in machine learning. It contains multiple graphs and demonstrates how to model the iris dataset with scikit-learn.<br>
**File(s) to note: iris-dataset.ipynb**

### MnistDataset Folder
This folder contains a folder called 'data'. This folder contains the Mnist dataset as gzip files. The 'MnistDataset' folder also contains a folder called 'mnistImages' which contains 10000 images which have been generated by the notebook file. The notebook file itself discusses the Mnist dataset, and demonstrates how to abstract the images from the gzip file.<br>
**File(s) to note: mnist-dataset.ipynb**

### DigitRecognition Folder
This folder contain 11 images, 10 of which are used for checking against the the python script. The last image is used for display purposes in the notebook file. The python script illustrates how to build a neural network for digit recognition, and checks to see can it correctly guess a given digit (image). The final file is the notebook. This notebook goes into detail about describing the python script, and gives details and insight into digit recognition.<br>
**File(s) to note: digit-recognition.ipynb, digitrec.py**


*Each folder contains a sub folder called ".ipynb_checkpoints", this is generated automatically for jupyter notebook files*
### Images Folder
This folder contains images used throughout this project

## How To
**1.1**
To run this project, check and make sure you have all technologies noted below.<br><br>
**1.2**
To run the the notebooks, download the full project. Open command prompt inside the downloaded project folder. Simply enter the command:<br>
*jupyter notebook*
<br>
<br>
This will launch Jupyter Notebook within your browser. You can simply navigate through the folder structure to view the notebooks. Alternatively, you can just view the notebooks within github.<br><br>
**1.3**
To run the python script, you must open command prompt where the script is located. You then run the following command(s):
<br>
*python digitrec.py*
<br>
**or**
<br>
*python digitrec.py one.jpg*
