## Description
This project was created for the purpose of demonstrating emerging technologies in the field of A.I. and Machine Learning. It covers the basic steps needed to understanding Machine Learning.

## Project Timeline
Research

## Content
The repository contains 5 folders. These folders contain various Jupyter Notebooks. See headings below for the contents of each folder:

### NumpyRandom Folder
This folder contains one file which discusses the uses of the numpy random package, along with plots.<br>
**File(s) to note: numpy-random.ipynb**

### IrisDataset Folder
This folder contains one file which discusses the iris dataset, along with its uses in machine learning. It contains multiple graphs and demonstrates how to model the iris dataset with scikit-learn.<br>
**File(s) to note: iris-dataset.ipynb**

### MnistDataset Folder
A jupyter notebook explaining how to read the MNIST dataset efficiently into memory in Python.

### DigitRecognition Folder
A Python script that takes an image file containing a handwritten digit and identifies the digit using a supervised learning algorithm and the MNIST dataset.

*Each folder contains a sub folder called ".ipynb_checkpoints", this is generated automatically for jupyter notebook files*
### Images
This folder contains images used throughout this project
